Subject: Enthusiastic 3D Artist Graduate from ESMA Lyon Seeking Opportunity at Mathematics

Bonjour à l'équipe de Mathematics,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Robin Delaporte, a recent graduate from ESMA Lyon with a strong passion for 3D art and animation. I came across Mathematics' impressive portfolio and was inspired to reach out, expressing my deep interest in joining your team.

During my time at ESMA, I had the privilege of co-directing the short film TRASH, honing my skills in modeling and lookdev. Additionally, my curiosity for code and pipeline development drove me to explore and learn more about the technical aspects of 3D art, allowing me to bring a well-rounded skill set to the table.

My ultimate goal is to dive into the world of 3D, specifically targeting the realms of advertising, luxury, and fashion. I am passionate about the creative synergy between design and technology, understanding the importance of staying adaptable, learning new techniques, and continuously pushing the envelope in these ever-evolving industries.

To give you a better understanding of my capabilities, I invite you to review my demo reel, which showcases my work in modeling, texturing, and shading: <https://youtu.be/Rz_nvQpV1SQ>

I am excited about the potential of joining Mathematics, contributing my skills, collaborating with your talented team, and growing within such a forward-thinking studio. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your ongoing success.

Sincerely,

Robin Delaporte
3D Artist
