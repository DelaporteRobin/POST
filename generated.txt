Subject: Excited to Apply as a 3D Artist at HA Studio Paris

Dear HA Studio Paris Team,

I am Robin Delaporte, a recent graduate from ESMA Lyon, and I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your esteemed studio. Your work, ranging from DJ Snake's visual projects to video games and advertisements, showcases a remarkable variety of media and an impressive storytelling ability. I am particularly drawn to the studio's unique identity and creative approach.

As a 3D artist, I specialize in modeling and lookdev, with a recent co-director position on the short film TRASH. My passion for 3D extends beyond just the artistic realm, as I am also interested in the technical side of the pipeline and enjoy exploring code. I am excited about the prospect of merging my artistic and technical skills to help bring your studio's projects to life.

My ambition is to apply my artistic abilities within the world of 3D, particularly in the realms of luxury, advertising, and fashion. I believe that being creative, adaptable, and eager to learn are essential qualities in these competitive industries.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your studio's outstanding roster of projects and learning from your talented team.

Sincerely,
Robin Delaporte
