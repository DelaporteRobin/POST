Subject: Excited to apply for a 3D Artist position at Service Généraux

Hello Service Généraux team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in any potential 3D Artist positions available at your esteemed studio. My name is Robin, and I have recently graduated from ESMA Lyon with a strong focus on sculpting, modeling, and lookdev.

During my time at ESMA, I had the privilege of serving as co-director for the short film TRASH. This experience allowed me to collaborate with a talented team, pushing my problem-solving skills and creativity to new heights. You can view the project and my reel on my personal website: [robin3dartist.com](http://robin3dartist.com).

As a 3D artist, I am particularly intrigued by the balance between artistic and technical aspects of our field. In addition to my artistic skills, I have a growing interest in coding and pipeline development. I believe that my artistic and technical background would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Service Généraux has a reputation for creating high-quality, captivating 3D content, and I am eager to contribute to your studio's success. I am confident that my passion for 3D art and my collaborative mindset will allow me to excel in a role with your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications further and exploring how I might fit within the Service Généraux family.

Best regards,

Robin
