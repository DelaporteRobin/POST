Subject: Excited to apply for a 3D Artist position at Alter Bureau

Hello Alter Bureau team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Robin, a recent graduate of ESMA Lyon, with a strong passion for 3D art and a recent success as a co-director for the short film TRASH.

I came across your studio's incredible work on your website (<https://www.alterbureau.com/>) and was particularly impressed by your blend of creativity, storytelling, and attention to detail in the 3D art you produce. It is with great enthusiasm that I express my interest in joining your team as a 3D Artist.

My specialties lie in sculpting, modeling, and lookdev, and I am constantly eager to learn and grow. I have a strong foundation in industry-standard software such as ZBrush, Maya, Substance Painter, and Mari, which I believe align with the tools you use. Additionally, I have a growing interest in code and pipeline development, allowing me to contribute to process optimization and automation in the studio.

My ultimate goal is to combine my skills and passion in the world of 3D, whether in the realm of advertising or fashion. I am also deeply drawn to the luxury industry and the challenges it presents for visually stunning and immersive creations. I believe my background and experience would be an excellent match with Alter Bureau's projects and client base.

I have attached some of my most recent modeling and lookdev projects. I am more than happy to provide more examples, a resume, or discuss any questions about my work.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills to the Alter Bureau team and help create even more amazing work.

Warm regards,

Robin
